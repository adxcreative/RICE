## Download LPR4M dataset
### Download files
### Install ***img2dataset***
```bash
pip install img2dataset
```
img2dataset can easily turn large sets of image urls to an image dataset. It can download, resize and package 100M urls in 20h on one machine. For better performance, it's highly recommended to set up a fast dns resolver, see [this section](https://github.com/rom1504/img2dataset#setting-up-a-high-performance-dns-resolver)
For example, [LAION-5B](https://laion.ai/blog/laion-5b/) contains 5B image/text pairs that can be downloaded by img2dataset in 7 days using 10 nodes.
